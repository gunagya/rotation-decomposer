	N. J. Ross and P. Selinger, "Optimal ancilla-free Clifford+T
	approximation of z-rotations", arXiv:1403.2975. Added a module
	GridProblem for solving one- and two-dimensional grid equations,
	and a module Diophantine for solving a Diophantine equation.
	Removed the now obsolete Newsynth algorithm, and replaced it by a
	backward compatibile interface to the new algorithm. New modules
	GridSynth, QuadraticEquation, and StepComp. Additions and minor
	improvements to EuclideanDomain, LaTeX, Matrix, and Ring. New
	executable gridsynth.

	(2014/02/04) PS1 - new functions euclid_divides and euclid_associates.
	(2014/02/04) PS1 - changed 'lobit' and improved its asymptotic
	efficiency.
	(2014/02/04) PS1 - fixed a bug in the ShowLaTeX instance of Rational.
	(2014/02/04) PS1 - added profiling options.
	(2014/02/03) PS1 - eliminated common subexpressions in gridpoints.
	(2014/02/03) PS1 - made fromDyadic an operation of the HalfRing

	make output parseable.
	(2013/12/13) PS1 - refactored as a Cabal package.
	(2013/12/11) PS1 - removed erroneous Adjoint2 instances for Double
	and Float.
